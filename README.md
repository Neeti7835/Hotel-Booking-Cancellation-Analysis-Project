# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Analysis-Project
Excited to share my recent data analysis project where I explored key factors behind hotel booking cancellations using Excel. This project helped me uncover important trends that can improve hotel management strategies and customer retention. Here's a quick overview:

üîç Project Highlights:

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handled raw data by cleaning missing values and standardizing entries to ensure accuracy.

Analysis of Cancellation Rates: Identified patterns in booking cancellations by comparing factors like lead time, customer type, room type, and market segment.

Visualizing Trends: Used pivot tables and Excel charts to visualize key trends. Found that longer lead times and non-refundable bookings were major contributors to cancellations.

Actionable Insights: Based on my analysis, I recommended strategies to reduce cancellations, such as offering flexible booking options and adjusting pricing for early bookings.

üí° Key Findings:

Guests with longer lead times were more likely to cancel.

Non-refundable bookings saw higher cancellation rates compared to flexible bookings.

Group bookings and online travel agent (OTA) bookings had distinct patterns of cancellation behavior.

üìà Conclusion:
This project gave me valuable insights into how data analysis can drive operational improvements in the hotel industry. By better understanding the factors behind cancellations, hotels can implement targeted strategies to reduce them, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize revenue management.

Looking forward to applying these skills in future business analysis projects and continuing my journey in data-driven decision-making!
